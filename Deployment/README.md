The docker-compose.yml file contained in this directory is to be used when deploying the app to an AWS ECS cluster.  Note that the cluster and it's associated stack must already exist before deploying with this script.  Please ensure that you have run `ecs-cli configure` and set the appropriate values for the `--profile`, `--region` and `--cluster` options before running `ecs compose up`.  If you don't know what any of these terms mean you should not be reading this file!
